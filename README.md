# Project Name

JQuery Server Side Calculator

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a calculator that receives two inputs and evaluates the calculation on the server side, not the client side.  To solve this, I used AJAX to send this data as well as the operator selected to the server, so long as all fields were completed.  The server then ran one of four functions to provide an answer, depending on the operator selected.  I stored these functions in a modules folder and sourced them into the server.js itself to make the code more readable.  The server then sent the result back to the client, as well as the total history of calculations made, which is then appended to the DOM.
